3a and 3b  What is Morse Code and who developed Morse Code?
Morse code was developed to support communication by telegraph.  The scheme is named after Samuel Morse, the inventor of the telegraph, and refined into a standard form by Alfred Vail in 1840 to include letters and special characters.  The Code uses combinations of short and long pulses of a constant sound, light, or electric signal, called “dots” and “dashes”, to represent characters.  Dashes last 3 time as long as dots.  Each letter and number is assigned a unique combination of dots and dashes.  Characters in a word are spaced in time by silence equivalent to 3 dots.  Words are spaced by a time by silence equal to 7 dots.  For efficiency, the most commonly used characters in English have shorter codes than those used less frequently.
